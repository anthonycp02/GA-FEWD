			I love working in tech! 
			</h3>
			<p>
			I have worked in the world of tech for about 4 years now. In my 4 years I have worn a number of different hats from visual design to marketing to ux design to where I now am working as a ux strategist. In UX strategy, I primarily focus on site optimization as well as always maintaining a hand in the direction my company moves. 

			As for my personal life, I have a wife and daughter and pretty much spend in free time I can spare with them. 

			I am finishing up my undergrad at UT after having spent 2 years at TCU up in Fort Worth, Texas.
